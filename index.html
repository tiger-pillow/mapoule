One day, they decided to cycle to Lac de Joux. With only one piece of toast in stomach, Yiyuan barely made to the Col de Mollendruz. Thibaut was very encouraging and patient.
They made back home safely, and he was wearing the Hard Rock Cafe shirt, and Yiyuan found him super sexy.</p><ul class="actions stacked"><li><a href=#second class=button>Next</a></li></ul></div><div class=image><img src=images/lacdejoux.jpeg alt></div></section><section class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id=second><div class=content><h2>Lavaux</h2><p>Thithi and Yiyuan rode to Lavaux, and that's the day when he finally asked her "will you be my girlfriend?

He said: it's up to you. She said: screw it, let's go. So they had a wonderful night with their new friend at
Montreux Jazz Festival. They ordered fries. Yiyuan was impressed by Belgian mayo.

And Thithi is a little crazy. So they decided to cycle Iceland -- begin with the hard mode.
They have gone through so much together -- brushing teeth with ice cold water, making through the fog, wind and rain, dealing with cars and RVs, finding windless campspot (mostly Thithi's responsibility).
It's truly a journey of a lifetime, yet they made it together when they were both 23!

That when they just arrived at Iceland, there was a sizable earthquake. By the time they cycled to Grindavik, the volcano was erupting. The night
was mesmerizing.

After returning to Switzerland,
they went on a hike at Yiyuan's favorite refuge in Italy, where she got a hat, and he got a shirt. They saw a real sheperd on the way, and Thibaut
patted the sheep and goats. Thithi left after a few days, and thus they began their long-distance relationship.</p><ul class="actions stacked"><li><a href=#seventh class=button>Next</a></li></ul></div><div class=image><img src=images/coumayeur.jpeg alt></div></section><section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id=first><div class=content><h2>Paris</h2><p>Their first meet up since LDR was at Paris -- for another Tsew's concert. Yiyuan loved the place that Thibaut found -- an airbnb by Lucy. It was the perfect size, with adorable, cozy and homie
decorations, and a very nice bakery downstairs where Thithi and Yiyuan got their fresh bread. Lucy has a really really thick blanket, ridiculous. One day Yiyuan woke up in the middle of the night and stripped off her clothes, and then went back to sleep.
They were both sweating so much in that bed.
They ate a lot of Chinese food, went around to museums, shops, drank wine and walked a lot. Yiyuan loved that weekend.</p><ul class="actions stacked"><li><a href=# class=button>Next</a></li></ul></div><div class=image><img src=images/parisbread.jpeg alt></div></section><section class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id=sixth><div class=content><h2>Crans-Montana</h2><p>Thithi came to visit Yiyuan in Switzerland!

Thithi picked her up from the airport (while parking at a weird place). Christmas was not as scary as
Yiyuan imagined. They rode the bike to see Papi, learned to play chess (got too competitive), ate lots of yummy food, and watched a movie in which Yiyuan fell asleep and started to snore.
Thithi was so kind to find a Harry Potter experience, and they saw a troll whose breath resembles Thithi's morning breath.</p><ul class="actions stacked"><li><a href=# class=button>Next</a></li></ul></div><div class=image><img src=images/troll.png alt></div></section><section class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id=sixth><div class=content><h2>Verbier</h2><p>Finally vacation time again! Yiyuan and Thibaut got into the rhythm of waking up, doing business after eating an egg sandwich + peanut butter, running for the bus,
skiing, going to the migros and cooking in a misty kitchen! Gabriella's place was very cute and good priced (thanks Thibaut), albeit a little cold (a little is an understatement).
They had a few small fights but they talked out of them very quickly. They also went uphill with a super ambitious goal, skied with friends, had fondue and pizza. They also had their best s** ever.
Upon returning to Lausanne, they went to jump spot and Yiyuan had her shoulder dislocated again, so they took the next day easy. Yiyuan ate the best pizza ever chez Mami, but thibaut
got AGAIN a pizza with anchoives, not his favorite.</p><ul class="actions stacked"><li><a href=#seventh class=button>Next</a></li></ul></div><div class=image><img src=images/verbiersmoke.jpeg alt></div></section><section class="wrapper style1 align-center"><div class=inner><h2>Poems</h2><p>Both Thithi and Yiyuan are quite talented.

Connect with Yiyuan for cultural diversity, exciting sports, fantastic laughters, and spectacular shows. Requirement: lots of patience, be able to laugh at your own joke, and called Thibaut Henri Roger Motteu</p></section><section><span class="icon solid style2 major"></span><h3>Nine - Thibaut</h3><p>Dear Ms. Fang
I have to say I feel honoured by your interest. I am aware that I would be a great fit for your business since - I don’t mean to brag here - I match all the requirements you mentioned. However, I am also a businessman myself, only today I already did business for about 30 minutes. As a consequence, working with you full time will be impossible.
The reason I accepted your connection request is I do not want to exclude a collaboration with you, you seem like an interesting woman with similar interests as me (f.e. culture, sports, humour). Moreover, you managed to intrigue me by mentioning some “shows” that I want to know more of.
When would you be free to talk more about this, eventually with a coffee?</p></section><section><span class="icon solid style2 major"></span><h3>Ten - Thibaut</h3><p>Je veux te faire des câlins Et t’avoir dans mes bras Je sais que je suis malin Même si tu penses que tu l’es plus que moi Toi et moi c’est le destin Je pense fort à toi, Ton poulain</p></section><section><span class="icon style2 major"></span><h3>Eleven - Yiyuan</h3><p>Quand nous étions à la gare, Je ne voulais pas te dire au revoir, Dans mon cœur je sais que tu es toujours là, Brillant fort parce que tu es mon étoile.

They got
together and have helped each other grow tremendously.<br><br>Unfortunately, they are not in the same city now, and the distance between them puts doubts in both of their heads. Yiyuan is sometimes a little negative, unsure about what she wants.
Thithi doesn't talk so much either. But they are both aware of their problems, and recognize how unique each other is, even in this world of 8 billion people.<br><br>Yiyuan wants to tell Thithi through this little story that she made, that she wants to try , and not give up this precious relationship easily. She is sorry that she is on the plane, and not with her baby, but they shall see each other soon.
Happy Valentine's day. Mon chargeur, mon poilu, mon amour, ma poule.
