  Thithi came to visit Yiyuan in Switzerland! They had a wonderful time together and asked each other ridiculous questions while hiking on Crans Montana. Yiyuan was a little sad at the beginning, but she felt better later. <br>THEY USED A WILD CARD!! </br> and they thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Thithi needs a lot of sleep, and Yiyuan loves it when he sleeps by her side. She feels so safe this way.
