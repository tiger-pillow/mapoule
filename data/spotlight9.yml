  Yiyuan arrived in Belgium after two months of not seeing Thithi. Thithi picked her up from the airport (while parking at a weird place). Christmas was not as scary as 
  Yiyuan imagined. They rode the bike to see Papi, learned to play chess (got too competitive), ate lots of yummy food, and watched a movie in which Yiyuan fell asleep and started to snore. 
  Thithi was so kind to find a Harry Potter experience, and they saw a troll whose breath resembles Thithi's morning breath.
