  Their first meet up since LDR was at Paris -- for another Tsew's concert. Yiyuan loved the place that Thibaut found -- an airbnb by Lucy. It was the perfect size, with adorable, cozy and homie 
  decorations, and a very nice bakery downstairs where Thithi and Yiyuan got their fresh bread. Lucy has a really really thick blanket, ridiculous. One day Yiyuan woke up in the middle of the night and stripped off her clothes, and then went back to sleep. 
  They were both sweating so much in that bed. 
  They ate a lot of Chinese food, went around to museums, shops, drank wine and walked a lot. Yiyuan loved that weekend.
