  Yiyuan likes to skip steps, as what she has been doing all her life. And Thithi is a little crazy. So they decided to cycle Iceland -- begin with the hard mode. 
  They have gone through so much together -- brushing teeth with ice cold water, making through the fog, wind and rain, dealing with cars and RVs, finding windless campspot (mostly Thithi's responsibility). 
  It's truly a journey of a lifetime, yet they made it together when they were both 23! "
