  Thithi and Yiyuan met as roommates, and somehow their sense of humor, love of sports and mountains, and internal weirdness gradually revealed themselves. They got 
  together and have helped each other grow tremendously. 
  <br/><br/>
  Unfortunately, they are not in the same city now, and the distance between them puts doubts in both of their heads. Yiyuan is sometimes a little negative, unsure about what she wants. 
  Thithi doesn't talk so much either. But they are both aware of their problems, and recognize how unique each other is, even in this world of 8 billion people. 
  <br/><br/>
  Yiyuan wants to tell Thithi through this little story that she made, that she wants to try , and not give up this precious relationship easily. She is sorry that she is on the plane, and not with her baby, but they shall see each other soon. 

  <br/><br/> 
 <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>
  Happy Valentine's day. Mon chargeur, mon poilu, mon amour, ma poule. 

  <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
  Yiyuan
